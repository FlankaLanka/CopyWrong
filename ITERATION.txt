I can categorize the feedback I recieved into three sections: rework for player experience, rework for additional platformer elements, and rework for player accessability and overall design.
Reworking for player experience means creating less slippery of a jump and removing momentum since this is a platformer that requires precision. The game is also paused for the player when the level loads so the player can think until they are ready to play. Overall, also made the game a little easier by increasing jump height and removing hard jumps as many people had trouble beating levels.
Reworking for additional platformer elements means the addition of spikes, lever that opens closed areas, transparent blocks, and a bush shield. These were suggested as my gold_spike was a little dull of platformer elements.
Reworking for player accessability and overall design in general involves the addition of high score and keyboard buttons that allow quick restarts and quits. Feedback suggested players take a lot of attempts at a single level. Thus, providing quick restarts can help the accessibility of levels.
